####Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway. It consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The cells evolve over discrete time steps according to certain rules:

A living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies (underpopulation).
A living cell with two or three living neighbors survives.
A living cell with more than three living neighbors dies (overpopulation).
A dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).
